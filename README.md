# Mobile-Air-Quality-Sensor-Vizualization

Technology:
[Smart Citizen Kit](https://smartcitizen.me/)
[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
Server with PHP and MySql database

References:

[Roadside Air Quality Index - NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide) Website](http://makerbench.org/air/)

First step: by using divide and counquer we found our tasks: 
* Python script to get data from Smart platform
* get GPS data from Android
* Combine both data
* Vizualize data on a map

Decisions:

Accesing database directly from vizualization because its clean. The approch from the marine litter tool postet on github has .gpx files that are visualized.
